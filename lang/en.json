We'll call it Web Developer v1.0 - Trainee, because they're still growing.",
  "aboutPop_info_title_text_2": "I invite you to be part of the air I furrow, to be my experience. That, in moments of strong gusts, knowing that you are there so that I can learn to stay in flight while we solve it. How beautiful it is to fly at different heights, temperatures! Because not everything is a gentle breeze, and that's what I like the most, otherwise I get bored. I want to be an expert flying through the air of Web Development. Flying with others to acquire values, methods, practices and make all of this my experience, feeling increasingly proud of myself.",
